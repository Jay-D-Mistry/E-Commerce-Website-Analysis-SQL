# E-Commerce-Website-Analysis-SQL
I leveraged SQL to conduct a comprehensive e-commerce website analysis, demonstrating a profound grasp of both data analysis techniques and an in-depth understanding of the e-commerce business domain. My insights are poised to drive data-informed decisions and enhance the bottom line.
This project showcases my understanding and proficiency in advanced SQL functions such as temporary table, subqueries, joins and many more.

The ecommerce data base that I used in this project has helped me to understand some of the website business concepts such as landing page analysis, bounce rate analysis, conversion funnels, product analysis, and much more.

In this report, I have shared overview of the data and project alongside with MYSQL queries and their results. Also, some statistical methods were mentioned to get the desired results in some questions.
